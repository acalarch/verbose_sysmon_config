# verbose_sysmon_config
This sysmon config is designed to log every event that sysmon can log on a Windows host. 
The config is demanding, it will cause a performance hit in your environment. I recommend only using in a Lab environment. 
This is probably mostly useful for detection engineers but, if you wish to log everything, this sysmon config is for you.
